Reflection from Assignment 1 and Assignment 2:

In completing Assignment 1 using Excel, I found that it provided a straightforward way to apply descriptive statistics and visualize data. However, Excel's capabilities are limited compared to Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib used in Assignment 2. Python allows for more complex data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, making it more suitable for handling large datasets and advanced statistical analysis.

When deciding between Excel and Python, I would choose Excel for quick exploratory data analysis or simple calculations and Python for more in-depth analysis requiring advanced statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms.

If I were to redo this assignment, I would focus on improving the visual aesthetics of the Excel workbook by using more varied chart types and enhancing the layout for better readability.
